The data consists of transactional, demographic, and geographical information for bank customers in an Indian bank.

In a high level, the project consists of the following steps:

1. Exploratory data analyses to uncover customer behavior and demographic trends. <br>
2. Features were created to enrich segmentation analysis. <br>
3. Data was cleaned and prepared for the KMeans clustering model. <br>
4. Hyperparameter tuning to identify optimal number of clusters. <br>
5. Post hoc analysis to identify cluster specific marketing as well as customer acquisition recommendations.
